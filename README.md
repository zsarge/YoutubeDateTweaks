Adds the amount of time since a youtube video was published next to the date.

Expect the date calculation to be off by a little bit for videos over a year old.

This is most accurate over short time spans, but it is always accurate to within a week.

-------

YoutubeDateTweaks.js is a userscript, a script that adds additional functionality to webpages.

It can be run with [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) on most browsers
and with [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) on Firefox.

--------

When zoomed in too far, the date element may be hidden by YouTube. This is to be expected.
